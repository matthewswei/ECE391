draw_vert_line
- vertical line was drawing incorrectly
  - moving screen to right
  - show_y and x where in incorrect positions (took 3 minutes to find)
  - fix was just chaning them to the correct positions and values
- Scrolling to right caused screen to go black or didn't update to new image section (looped around)
  - moving screen to right caused it to bug out
  - for loop issue (took 20 minutes to find, had to figure out how the drawing worked)
  - fix was to change the for loop (5 minutes)

  - Didn't account for total size (took 2 minutes to find, piazza)
  - Change variable to new one

  - Status bar showed the top part of buffer
  - Had to add offset (took 10 minutes to find)
  - Change some values to account for offset

text-to-gen
- Printing incorrectly
  - Tested on online compiler and printed out values
  - Bit shift wrote incorrectly, had to change it (other small minor bugs were found when changing the code) (30 minutes)
  - Changed the bit-shift operation
- Needed to incorporate other messages
  - After adding in adventure.c, realized other messages had to be printed
  - Not only room name had to be on status bar(5 minutes)
  - Copy, pasted, and altered existing code to fix (5 minutes)

- Typed and status messages weren't showing up when needed
  - Messages showing up in status bar were not correct as they should have been
  - Need a lock to synchronize the status bar changes (5 minutes)
